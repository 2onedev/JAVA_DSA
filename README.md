Welcome to my GitHub repository where I document my journey to become a better developer by learning Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) in Java. As a software engineer, I believe that mastering DSA is crucial for writing efficient, scalable, and maintainable code. This repository serves as a record of my progress, challenges, and learnings along the way.
Purpose
The main purpose of this repository is to:
Learn and implement various data structures and algorithms in Java
Improve my problem-solving skills by practicing coding challenges and interview questions
Document my progress and share my knowledge with the community
Prepare for technical interviews and coding assessments
Contents
This repository contains the following:
Implementations of common data structures in Java, such as arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, and more
Solutions to coding challenges from various sources, such as LeetCode, HackerRank, and GeeksforGeeks
Explanations and notes on the concepts and techniques used in the implementations and solutions
Benchmarks and performance analysis of the implemented data structures and algorithms
Learning Resources
Throughout my journey, I have used various resources to learn and practice DSA in Java. Some of the most helpful resources include:
Books: "Introduction to Algorithms" by Thomas H. Cormen, "Cracking the Coding Interview" by Gayle Laakmann McDowell, and "Grokking Algorithms" by Aditya Bhargava
Online Courses: "Data Structures and Algorithms in Java" by UC San Diego on Coursera, "Java Algorithms and Data Structures" by Princeton University on Coursera, and "Algorithms" by Stanford University on Coursera
Websites: LeetCode, HackerRank, GeeksforGeeks, and Exercism
Contributions
If you find any issues or have suggestions for improvements, feel free to create an issue or submit a pull request. I welcome contributions from the community to help me learn and grow as a developer.
Conclusion
I hope that this repository serves as a valuable resource for anyone interested in learning DSA in Java. By documenting my journey, I aim to inspire others to pursue their own learning goals and contribute to the growth of the software engineering community.
Happy coding!
